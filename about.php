            <h2>Welcome To Saffron Grill</h2>
            <p>
            To experience the full pleasure of Indian and Mediterranean cuisine, we invite you to visit us soon. Come and enjoy the vibrant, complex flavors and allow us to serve you the best cuisine in Seattle. Your family and friends will delight in discovering new, innovative dishes expertly prepared by our chef whose passion and expertise is unparalleled.</p>

            <p>Saffron’s signature dish, Butter Chicken, is simmered in a smooth tomato butter-cream sauce – hands down, the best in the business. The menu also features classic East Indian dishes, perfectly prepared: curries, tandooris, masalas, and biryanis with rich and delicate sauces that explode with flavor.</p>

            <p> Also noteworthy is the traditional Tikka Masala, available with beef, lamb, chicken, seafood or vegetarian style, alongside more uncommon dishes such as Jaipuri Masala. An exquisite dish originating from the city of Jaipur, this masala is prepared with tomatoes, onion, ginger, garlic, and paneer and is available with a variety of meat selections</p>

            <p>Shish Taouk, which is cubed, chicken marinated in garlic, oregano, and saffron is also highly recommended. Our menu offers many unique curries, anywhere from extra mild all the way to extremely hot. Just let your server know your preference and we will be happy to accommodate you.  </p>
